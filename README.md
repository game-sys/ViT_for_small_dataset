# How to train ViTs with small datasets?

## Overview

This project focuses on training ViT on small datasets

## Datasets

We will use the below-described datasets to do our initial experiments

| Dataset           | Train Images | Test Images | Classes | Approx. Train Images Per Class |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| Cifar-10          | 50,000       | 10,000      | 10      | 5,000                          |
| Cifar-100         | 50,000       | 10,000      | 100     | 500                            |
| Oxford Flowers102 | 2,040        | 6,149       | 102     | 20                             |
